Bootstrap uses HTML5 DOCTYPE at the begining of the page,along with the lang attribute and correct character set:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
	</head>
</html>

Bootstrap 3 is mobile first:
  Designed to be responsive to mobile devices.Mobile first styles are part of the core framework.

Addn following <meta> tag for proper rendering and touch zooming inside the <head> tag:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">

-width=device-width set the width of the page to follow the screen width of te devices.
-initial-scale=1 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Two container classes to choose	from:
